Introduction
------------

Being a movie fanatic, I thought it would be interesting to do a network analysis of actors and directors working together. I particularly wanted to see if any actor-director duo have an increased inclination towards working together. Thanks to Kaggle, where I obtained the IMDB 5000 movie dataset, I can find the answer to my question!

Although the original dataset I obtained has been removed by Kaggle, the original dataset can be found here at Dataworld.

Based on the massive movie information available, I wanted to analyze and visualize the network of actors and directors working together and the number of times they have worked together.

Data Exploration/ Loading/
--------------------------

Loading the packages I would need for my analyses.

``` r
# Loading packages
library(dplyr) # data manipulation
library(tidyr) # data tidying
library(stringr)
library(igraph) 
library(visNetwork) # Interactive visualization
```

Now that the packages are loaded, I read and explored the movie dataset. I decided, it is a good idea to replace all blank cells, if any, with NAs while loading the dataset before proceeding with any further analyses. This is to ensure I can easily exclude fields with NAs during my analyses when needed.

``` r
movie.data = read.csv('movie_metadata.csv', na.strings = c("","NA"), header = T)

# Exploring the structure of the dataset
str(movie.data)

There are 5043 observations and 28 variables. Since I am interested in working with the director\_name and actor\_name variables, I made sure they are in the format I want them to be. The director and actor variables are recognized as categorical, thus showing as factors. To ensure, I do not face any problems during my analysis, I converted them as characters before proceeding.

``` r
# Converting the variables as a character
movie.data$director_name = as.character(movie.data$director_name)
movie.data$actor_1_name = as.character(movie.data$actor_1_name)
movie.data$actor_2_name = as.character(movie.data$actor_2_name)
movie.data$actor_3_name = as.character(movie.data$actor_3_name)
```

Data Cleaning
-------------

In the dataset,there are some duplicate rows. I removed the duplicate rows and worked with the unique ones.

``` r
# Finding total number of duplicated rows
sum(duplicated(movie.data))
```

    ## [1] 45

``` r
# Removing duplicates from the dataset
movie.data = movie.data[!duplicated(movie.data),]
```

Now there are 4998 unique observations left. To further explore the data, I looked for missing values in each variable. As you would remember, while loading the data, I replaced all blank cells with NA. I used the colSums() function which returns the total number of NAs per column to see where and how much data is missing.

``` r
# Finding total number of NAs per column
colSums(sapply(movie.data, is.na)) 
```

Since I am doing a network analysis between directors and actors, I am more interested in the director\_name and actors\_x\_name variables. There are NAs in the director\_name and actor\_name column. Now for a proper network analysis, I would need both a director\_name and an actor\_name, since technically, there cannot be a relation with a blank/ a relation with a blank in non-existent, unless it's with a ghost.

I could have simply excluded all cases with NA. However, in doing so, I would lose way more entries, since there might be some directors who might have worked with only 2 actors, and since the actor\_3\_name variable would have NA, it would also be omitted, thus affecting the exact count of director\_name. Therefore, I excluded entries with NA only in the director\_name variable.

``` r
movie.data = movie.data %>% 
  drop_na(director_name) 
```

Data Tidying
------------

All the movie titles seemed to have a special character(ÃÂ) at end. Some also have some whitespaces. So I tidied them up using some regular expressions. I got to admit! Understanding regular expressions almost made me climb up the wall. But I think I've got a hang of it now, although, there's still lots to learn.

``` r
# Replacing ÃÂ and whitespaces with blanks using gsub() functions
movie.data$movie_title= gsub('ÃÂ','',movie.data$movie_title)
movie.data$movie_title= gsub('^\\s*$','',movie.data$movie_title)

# Removing the additional space at the end of the movie title
str_trim(movie.data$movie_title,'right') 
```

Since there are about 5000 unique observations, one could imagine the complexity of the network between 5000 directors and the respective actors they have worked with in their movies. So in order to be able to humanely visualize and decipher the network, I selected only the well rated movies, i.e. having an IMDB\_score of at least 8.

``` r
data = subset(movie.data,imdb_score >= 8)
```

Network Analysis
----------------

After all that data cleaning and tidying up, now this was the fun part!

The main aspect of networks are the numerous separate entities and the relation between them. The entities are called nodes or vertices, and the connections between them are called edges or links.

Nodeslist
=========

The package I used to create the network objects for my network analysis is igraph. To begin with, I created lists of distinct directors and actors as a dataframe, which are going to be my network entities (nodes) in the graph. Since there are 3 columns observing the name of actors in a movie, I created a separate list of distinct actors for each actor\_name column, and then used a full\_join() to obatin a list of all unique actors. I created separate lists for directors and actors as I intendeded to make a two-mode network.

The nodeslists contains a "names" column, containing the name of distinct directors and actors.

``` r
# List of distinct directors (Nodes Set 1)
directors = data %>% 
  distinct(director_name) %>% 
  rename(names = director_name)


# List of distinct actors (Nodes Set 2)
actors1 = data%>%
  distinct(actor_1_name) %>%
  rename(names=actor_1_name)
actors2 = data%>%
  distinct(actor_2_name) %>%
  rename(names=actor_2_name)
actors3 = data%>%
  distinct(actor_3_name) %>%
  rename(names=actor_3_name)

actors = full_join(actors1,actors2, by="names")
actors = full_join(actors,actors3, by="names")
```

I created 2 separate nodeslist for directors and actors, as I wanted to add/will be adding them separately into the function that will create the network objects. By doing so, I will be able to create a boolean "type" attibute that will indicate the difference between the actors and directors, and result in a bipartite graph object. It is worth mentioning, there are a few directors who have worked as an actor in their own movie. So I removed their names from the actors list to avoid duplication of nodes.

``` r
# List of directors who were also actors in their movies
subset(data, director_name==actor_1_name |director_name==actor_2_name | director_name==actor_3_name, 
       select = c(director_name, actor_1_name,actor_2_name,actor_3_name))
```

    ##          director_name      actor_1_name    actor_2_name     actor_3_name
    ## 1605    Clint Eastwood    Clint Eastwood  Morgan Freeman      Mike Colter
    ## 1783    Jacques Perrin    Jacques Perrin  Philippe Labro             <NA>
    ## 1870    Clint Eastwood    Clint Eastwood   Dreama Walker        Ahney Her
    ## 2761    Clint Eastwood    Clint Eastwood  Morgan Freeman   Frances Fisher
    ## 3288     Michael Moore     Michael Moore Tucker Albrizzi     Bill Clinton
    ## 3890       Woody Allen       Woody Allen      Carol Kane   Shelley Duvall
    ## 4055     Michael Moore     Michael Moore      Dick Clark     Bill Clinton
    ## 4285        Ari Folman        Ari Folman     Ronny Dayag   Zahava Solomon
    ## 4497 Quentin Tarantino Quentin Tarantino   Steve Buscemi       Chris Penn
    ## 4938     Bill Melendez     Peter Robbins   Bill Melendez Christopher Shea

``` r
# List of actors after removal of the directors above
actors = subset(actors, names != 'Ari Folman' &
                   names != 'Clint Eastwood' &
                   names != 'Jacques Perrin' &
                   names != 'Michael Moore' &
                   names != 'Quentin Tarantino' &
                   names != 'Woody Allen' &
                   names != 'Bill Melendez')
```

Edgelist
========

After obtaining the lists of distinct actors and directors, I created an edgelist in a similar fashion as creating the nodeslist of actors. Since there are 3 columns for actors, I created an edgelist for each actor column with directors. I also created a weight column that will count the number of times the actor-director duo have worked together. To create a single dataframe with the director-actor relation, I concatenated the 3 lists together using rbind().

``` r
# relation between actor 1 and director
edgelist_1 = data %>%  
  group_by(director_name,actor_1_name, movie_title) %>%
  summarise(weight = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  rename(actor_name = actor_1_name)

# relation between actor 2 and director
edgelist_2 = data %>%  
  group_by(director_name, actor_2_name, movie_title) %>%
  summarise(weight = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  rename(actor_name = actor_2_name)

# relation between actor 3 and director
edgelist_3 = data %>%  
  group_by(director_name, actor_3_name, movie_title) %>%
  summarise(weight = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  rename(actor_name = actor_3_name)

# Merging the two edgelist together to get final edgelist, using rbind() function.
edgelist = rbind(edgelist_1,edgelist_2,edgelist_3)

# Removing links self 
edgelist = subset(edgelist,director_name != actor_name) 
```

Like in the actors nodeslist, I excluded the relations existing within the same director to omit self edges. Currently the edgelist obtained consists of the names of the directors and actors who have worked together, the number of times they worked together and the movie they worked on. To simplify the edgelist obtained, I grouped the directors and actors to obtain a list with the movie titles in the same field and the weight column giving a total count of the movies.

``` r
edgelist = edgelist %>%
  group_by(director_name, actor_name) %>%
  summarise(movie_title= paste0(movie_title, collapse = ","), weight = n())
edgelist_links = select(edgelist, director_name, actor_name)
```

Creating network objects using igraph
=====================================

I used the graph.empty() function to create the network objetcs. Since I was interested in creating a bipartite network, I introduced a boolean "type" attribute in the nodeslist, which distinguishes the nodes for directors and actors.

``` r
# Creating and introducing "type" attibute in the vertices
bg = make_empty_graph()
bg = add_vertices(bg,nv=length(directors$names), attr = list(name=directors$names, 
                                                               type = rep(TRUE, length(directors$names))))
bg = add_vertices(bg,nv=length(actors$names), attr = list(name=actors$names, 
                                                             type= rep(FALSE, length(actors$names))))

# Adding the edges
edgeListVec <- as.vector(t(as.matrix(data.frame(edgelist_links))))
bg <- add.edges(bg,edgeListVec)

# Confirming if the graph object is bipartite
is.bipartite(bg)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

Interative network visualization using visNetwork
-------------------------------------------------

Once I confirmed the network objects I created were bipartite, I used the visNetwork package to create the interactive graph. Since I have already created my igraph network objects, I decided to use \_\_\_\_ visIgraph() to create the interactive graph, which renders a visNetwork network object from an igraph network object and directly plots an igraph object in visNetwork.

Before plotting the graph, I assigned various attributes to the network object to include visual properties that will be used when plotting the network.

The resulting graph is quite fun to play with. Feel free to move the nodes around by clicks, and hover the mouse over the nodes to see the names of the movies they worked on together. You can also zoom in and out of the plot and move it around.

``` r
# Passing information to the network to have different colors for the types of nodes
V(bg)$color = c('skyblue', 'tomato')[V(bg)$type+1] 

# Setting the size of the nodes
V(bg)$size = 20

# Setting the labels displaying on the nodes
E(bg)$title = edgelist$movie_title  # to display movie name upon hovering on the edges. Works fine

# Changing the color of the edges
E(bg)$color = 'gray'

# Setting the width of the edges based on weight
E(bg)$width = edgelist$weight # edge width based on weight from edgelist_final

# Plotting the network to create an interactive graph
visIgraph(bg, smooth = FALSE) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = 'layout.fruchterman.reingold') %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE, nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>%
  visInteraction(hover = TRUE)
```
